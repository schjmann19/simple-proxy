# POST & GET only HTTP proxy

this is a simple HTTP proxy made to properly display UTF-8 and block given folders based on a config file

it was not made by me, but the author prefers that I have it in here, and handle any issues.


to build, simply use cargo.
$ cargo build --release

note: this thing, as-is, is good enough for what is was made
